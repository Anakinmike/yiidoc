Yii Documentation Project
=========================

This project aims to translate various Yii documentation into
different languages.

Currently, we are working on translating the definitive guide to Yii.
The original copy is located under the folder 'guide-source'.
All translations should be put under the folder 'guide/<lang>',
where <lang> stands for the language code (e.g. 'de' for German,
'zh_cn' for simplified Chinese) of the translation.

Make sure you use UTF-8 encoding to save your translations.

We will include the latest translations into every release of Yii,
and also display them online.

Thank you for your support and contribution to Yii!
